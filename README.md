# DATA-ANALYSIS-UISNG-PYTHON
Analyse TMDB movie data using Python for valuable industry insights.

TMDB provides an API(Application programming interface) and downloadable datasets that contain information on thousands of movies and TV shows. Analysts and data scientists can access this data to perform various types of analyses.
The TMDB movie data analysis can vary widely. Common goals include understanding audience preferences, predicting box office success, assessing the impact of genres, analyzing actor/director influence, and evaluating the relationship between ratings and revenue.
 Before diving into analysis, it's essential to explore the dataset. This involves checking for missing data, understanding data types, and gaining a general overview of the dataset's structure.
Basic statistics can help provide insights into key metrics like movie budgets, revenue, ratings, and popularity. Common statistics include mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles.
Visualization tools such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms can make the data more accessible and provide insights into trends and patterns. For example, visualizing the distribution of movie ratings or budget vs. revenue relationships can reveal interesting patterns.
